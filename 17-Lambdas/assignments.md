## Use Streams and Lambdas for all the below programs.

#### Given an array of Strings, write a program to Capitalize the first letter of the each String, and print the strings in alphabetical order.

#### Given an array of strings, write a program to print the strings that contains a vowels. Print string and number of Vowels.

#### Given an array of Integers, write a program to find the average of squares of all the odd numbers.

#### Given an array of strings, write a program to sort the array based on the following criteria:
  - First, sort the strings based on their lengths in ascending order.
  - If two strings have the same length, sort them in descending order based on the their last characters.

#### Create a functional interface called MathOperation with a single method int operate(int a, int b). Implement this interface using a lambda expression to perform addition.

#### Implement a method that takes a list of strings and a predicate (using a lambda expression) to filter out strings starting with the letter "A".

#### Given a list of integers, filter out the even numbers and then double each remaining number using streams.

#### Calculate the sum of the squares of all positive integers in a given list using streams.

#### Find the maximum element from a list of strings using streams. Consider the maximum element based on natural sorting order.

#### Write a program to remove duplicate elements from a list of integers using streams.

#### Given a list of strings, group them by their length using streams.
