#### What is an object?
    An object is a real-world entity which is the basic unit of OOPs for example chair, cat, dog, etc. Different objects have different states or attributes, and behaviors.

    A class is a prototype that consists of objects in different states and with different behaviors. It has a number of methods that are common for the objects created with that class.

#### What is Object Oriented Programming?
    Object-Oriented Programming(OOPs) is a type of programming that is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures. Individual objects are grouped into classes. OOPs implements real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, hiding, etc into programming. It also allows binding data and code together.
