1. Create an Abstract class "Department.java" that contains abstract method "getDepartmenSize" which returns an integer.
  - create a subclass to Department.java and implement the abstract method.

2. Create a class "Product.java" with variable "price" of type double. Price indicates price for single quantity of the product.
  - Create a getter and setter methods for price variable.
  - Create an overloaded method for price getter method. Overloaded method should take quantity as a method parameter and return the price based on the quantity.

3. Write a program to illustrate the concept of runtime polymorphism in Java. Choose any names for the parent and child classes, as well as the overridden method.
