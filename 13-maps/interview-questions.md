#### What is a HashMap in Java, and how does it work?
- A HashMap is a data structure in Java that implements the Map interface. It stores key-value pairs and allows efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of elements. Internally, it uses an array of buckets and a hash function to determine the bucket where each key-value pair should be stored. In case of hash collisions, where two different keys have the same hash value, the HashMap uses a technique called chaining, where multiple entries with the same hash value are stored in the same bucket as a linked list.


#### What is the difference between HashMap and Hashtable?
- HashMap and Hashtable are both implementations of the Map interface in Java, but there are a few differences:

  - HashMap is not synchronized and is not thread-safe, whereas Hashtable is synchronized and can be used in multi-threaded environments.
  - HashMap allows null values and a null key, whereas Hashtable does not allow null values or keys.
  - HashMap is generally preferred for most scenarios due to its better performance, unless thread-safety is required.

#### How does HashMap handle hash collisions?
- When a hash collision occurs in HashMap, meaning two different keys have the same hash value, HashMap uses chaining to handle it. The entries with the same hash value are stored in the same bucket as a linked list. During insertion, new entries are added to the head of the linked list. During retrieval, the linked list is traversed to find the entry with the matching key.

#### What is the time complexity of key operations in HashMap?
- The time complexity of key operations in HashMap, such as get() and put(), is generally O(1) on average. This means that the time taken is constant or near-constant, regardless of the size of the HashMap. However, in rare cases where there are many hash collisions, the time complexity can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of entries.

#### Can a HashMap contain duplicate values?
- Yes, a HashMap can contain duplicate values. Each key in a HashMap must be unique, but different keys can map to the same value. In other words, the values in a HashMap can be duplicated.
