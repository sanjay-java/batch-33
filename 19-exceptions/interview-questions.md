#### What are the Exception Handling Keywords in Java?

  - There are four keywords used in java exception handling.

    - throw: Sometimes we explicitly want to create an exception object and then throw it to halt the normal processing of the program. The throw keyword is used to throw exceptions to the runtime to handle it.

    - throws: When we are throwing any checked exception in a method and not handling it, then we need to use the throws keyword in the method signature to let the caller program know the exceptions that might be thrown by the method. The caller method might handle these exceptions or propagate them to its caller method using the throws keyword. We can provide multiple exceptions in the throws clause and it can be used with the main() method also.

    - try-catch: We use try-catch block for exception handling in our code. try is the start of the block and catch is at the end of the try block to handle the exceptions. We can have multiple catch blocks with a try and try-catch blocks can be nested also. catch block requires a parameter that should be of type Exception.

    - finally: The finally block is optional and can be used only with a try-catch block. Since exception halts the process of execution, we might have some resources open that will not get closed, so we can use the finally block. The finally block gets executed always, whether an exception occurs or not.

#### What are exception types in Java

  - Errors are exceptional scenarios that are out of the scope of application and it’s not possible to anticipate and recover from them, for example, hardware failure, JVM crash, or out-of-memory error.

  - Checked Exceptions are exceptional scenarios that we can anticipate in a program and try to recover from it, for example, FileNotFoundException. We should catch this exception and provide a useful message to the user and log it properly for debugging purposes. Exception is the parent class of all Checked Exceptions.

  - Runtime Exceptions are caused by bad programming, for example, trying to retrieve an element from the Array. We should check the length of the array first before trying to retrieve the element otherwise it might throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException at runtime. RuntimeException is the parent class of all runtime exceptions.

####  What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions in Java?
  - Checked Exceptions should be handled in the code using try-catch block or else the method should use the throws keyword to let the caller know about the checked exceptions that might be thrown from the method. Unchecked Exceptions are not required to be handled in the program or to mention them in the throws clause of the method.

  - Exception is the superclass of all checked exceptions whereas     RuntimeException is the superclass of all unchecked exceptions. Note that RuntimeException is the child class of Exception.

  - Checked exceptions are error scenarios that require to be handled in the code, or else you will get compile time error. For example, if you use FileReader to read a file, it throws FileNotFoundException and we must catch it in the try-catch block or throw it again to the caller method. Unchecked exceptions are mostly caused by poor programming, for example, NullPointerException when invoking a method on an object reference without making sure that it’s not null. For example, I can write a method to remove all the vowels from the string. It’s the caller’s responsibility to make sure not to pass a null string. I might change the method to handle these scenarios but ideally, the caller should take care of this.
#### What is the difference between the throw and throws keyword in Java?

  - throws keyword is used with method signature to declare the exceptions that the method might throw whereas throw keyword is used to disrupt the flow of the program and handing over the exception object to runtime to handle it.

#### What is OutOfMemoryError in Java?
  - OutOfMemoryError in Java is a subclass of java.lang.VirtualMachineError and it’s thrown by JVM when it ran out of heap memory. We can fix this error by providing more memory to run the java application through java options.

#### What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize in Java?
  -  final and finally are keywords in java whereas finalize is a method.

  - final keyword can be used with class variables so that they can’t be reassigned, with the class to avoid extending by classes and with methods to avoid overriding by subclasses, finally keyword is used with try-catch block to provide statements that will always get executed even if some exception arises, usually finally is used to close resources. finalize() method is executed by Garbage Collector before the object is destroyed, it’s a great way to make sure all the global resources are closed.

  - Out of the three, only finally is related to java exception handling.
