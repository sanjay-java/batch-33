#### What is JVM ?

  A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a process virtual machine that can execute Java bytecode. Each Java source file is compiled into a bytecode file, which is executed by the JVM.

#### What is the Difference between JDK and JRE ?
  JRE is the implementation of JVM. It provides a platform to execute java programs. JRE consists of JVM, Java binaries, and other classes to execute any program successfully.
  The Java Development Kit (JDK) is the full featured Software Development Kit for Java, including the JRE, the compilers and tools (like JavaDoc, and Java Debugger), in order for a user to develop, compile and execute Java applications.

#### Why is Java called the “Platform Independent Programming Language” ?
    The java code is compiled into byte code which can run on any operating systems where JVM is installed. The bytecode conversion makes JAVA a platform Independent without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform.
    A Java virtual machine makes this possible, because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the underlying hardware platform.
